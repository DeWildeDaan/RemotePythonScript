This repo was meant to test the downloading/execution of remotely stored python scripts on a local machine.
In each python script are 2 options to execute the script locally commented at the bottom.
I found that in both options of executing this script, you had to pass in the raw version of the file.

**WARNING: always be sure you trust a remotely stored script before you run it like this.**
